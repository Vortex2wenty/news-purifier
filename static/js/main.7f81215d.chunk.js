It informs us what we are allowed to do and not allowed to do, as well as crucial information such as new restrictions or lockdowns. As important as news like this can be, it adds a lot of extra stress to our lives. We are constantly being flooded with information all around the Internet, whether we like it or not. Sometimes, we just want to get away from the noise and have some peace in our lives. The solution that immediately comes to mind is disconnecting from our online presence, whether that be for an hour, a day, or even a week. However, this is extremely hard to do in these current situations, considering a lot of our lives is online, whether that be talking with friends, school, work, and so on. With that in mind, I have come up with a tool called News Purifier. With the News Purifier extension, you can filter out the bad news with just a click of a button. Behind the scenes, with a list of certain keywords for certain news subjects (e.g. violence, COVID-19, etc.), we will get rid of those articles from your news feed on supported sites (see supported sites for more info). You can either choose a pre-configured keyword to replace that article (from which we will automatically choose an article for you), or you can choose to just simply remove it from your sight. This is mostly a proof of concept, with basic functionality currently implemented but a more complex foundational idea."})]})]}):"faq"===this.state.page?Object(b.jsxs)("div",{id:"body",children:[Object(b.jsx)(u,{changePage:this.changePage}),Object(b.jsxs)("div",{class:"text-center",children:[Object(b.jsx)("h1",{class:"display-5 fw-bold",children:"FAQ"}),Object(b.jsx)("h2",{children:"What does this do?"}),Object(b.jsx)("p",{class:"lead w-75 m-auto mb-4",children:"An extension for Google Chrome which allows you to \u201cpurify\u201d your news feed with subjects to your liking.
